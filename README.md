**Image Forgery Detection**

This project is part of the final semester of my Masters in Artificial Intelligence course.

This Project focuses on detecting image forgery using a convolution neural network model trained on the CASIA V2 dataset. 
The goal is to identify whether an image has been manipulated or forged, aiding in the detection of digital image tampering.

**Features:**
1. Upload an image to the web interface for forgery detection.
2. Preprocess the image using Error Level Analysis (ELA) to enhance differences.
3. Utilise a pre-trained CNN model to predict whether the image is real or fake.
4. View the detection result indicating whether the image is authentic or tampered.

**Technology Used:** 
1. Python
2. Flask (for Web App)
3. Tensorflow and keras (for the CNN model)
4. Python Imaging Library-PIL (for image processing.

**Run on your local machine:**
1. Clone the repository on your local machine.
2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code or Pycharm (Your choice)
3. Train the CNN model using the provided dataset link or your own dataset.
4. Run the flask app to start the webapp interface.
5. Upload the image and view the predicted result.
